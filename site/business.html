        <div class="description">
          <p>
            Our principal products are snacks, such as crackers, savory snacks,
            toaster pastries, cereal bars, granola bars and bites; and
            convenience food, such as, ready-to-eat cereals, frozen waffles,
            veggie foods and noodles. These products were, as of February 21,
            2023, manufactured by us in 21 countries and marketed in more than
            180 countries. They are sold to retailers thorugh direct sales
            forces for resale to consumers. We use broker and distributor
            arrangements for certain products and channels, as well as in
            certain geographies.
            <br /><br />
            Our snacks brands are marketed under brands such as Kellogg's,
            Cheez-It, Pringles, Austin, Parati, and RXBAR. Our cereals and
            cereal bars are generally marketed under the Kellogg's name, with
            some under the Kashi and Bear Naked Brands. Our Frozen food are
            marketed under the Eggo and Morningstar Farms brands.
            <br /><br />
            Demand for our products generally level throughout the year,
            although some of our convenience foods have a bias for stronger
            demand in the second half of the year due to events and holidays.

          <p>
            Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates,
            accounted for approximately 18% of consolidated net sales during
            2022, comprised principally of sales within the United States. No
            other customer accounted for greater than 10% of net sales in 2022.
            <br /><br />
            During 2022, out top five customers, collectively, including
            Wal-Mart, accounted for approximately 32% of our consolidated net
            sanes and aproximately 53% of U.S. net sales. There has been
            significant worldwide consolidation in the forcery industry and we
            believe that this trend is likely to continue. Although the loss of
            any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively
            impact our sales and profits, we do not anticipate that this will
            occur to a significant extent due to the customer demand for our
            products and our relationships with out customers. Our products have
            been generally sold through our own sales forces and through broker
            and distributor arrangements, and have been generally resold to
            consumers in retail stores, restaurants, and other food service
            establishments.

            Our products compete with advertised and branded products of a
            similar nature as well as unadvertised and private label products,
            which are typically distributed at lower prices, and generally with
            other food products. Principal methods and factors of competition
            include new product introductions, product quality, taste,
            convenience, nutrition value, price, advertising and promotion.
